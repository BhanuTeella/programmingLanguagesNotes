comparison of the lexical units between C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript:

Keywords:
C++: C++ has keywords like if, for, while, class, int, float, etc.
Python: Python has keywords such as if, for, while, class, def, True, False, etc.
Java: Java keywords include if, for, while, class, int, float, true, false, etc.
JavaScript: JavaScript has keywords like if, for, while, class, function, true, false, etc.

Identifiers:
C++: C++ allows identifiers consisting of letters, digits, and underscores, with the first character being a letter or an underscore.
Python: Python identifiers can consist of letters, digits, and underscores, with the first character being a letter or an underscore.
Java: Java identifiers follow the same rules as C++, allowing letters, digits, and underscores, with the first character being a letter.
JavaScript: JavaScript identifiers also permit letters, digits, and underscores, with the first character being a letter.

Literals:
C++: C++ supports numeric literals (42, 3.14), character literals ('a', 'b'), string literals ("Hello", "World"), and boolean literals (true, false).
Python: Python supports numeric literals (42, 3.14), string literals ("Hello", "World"), and boolean literals (True, False).

JavaScript: JavaScript supports numeric literals (42, 3.14), string literals ("Hello", "World"), and boolean literals (true, false).

Operators:
C++: C++ has operators like arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=), assignment operators (=, +=, -=), etc.
Python: Python has similar operators to C++ for arithmetic, comparison, and assignment, but with a few differences in syntax.
Java: Java has operators similar to C++ for arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operations.
JavaScript: JavaScript has operators similar to C++ for arithmetic, comparison, and assignment, but also includes some additional operators and features specific to the language.

Punctuation:
C++: C++ uses punctuation symbols like parentheses (), curly braces {}, square brackets [], commas ,, semicolons ;, etc.
Python: Python uses parentheses (), colons :, commas ,, periods ., etc., for punctuation.
Java: Java uses similar punctuation symbols to C++, such as parentheses (), curly braces {}, square brackets [], commas ,, semicolons ;, etc.

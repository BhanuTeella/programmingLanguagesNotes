Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands in programming languages. Here are some examples of operators and their usage in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript:

C++: C++ has a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, and assignment operators. Some common operators include:
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    Logical operators: &&, ||, !
    Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
    Unary operators: ++, --, +,-,!
    class member operators: 
        :: scope access/ resolution
    conditional operator: ?  


Python: Python also has a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, and assignment operators. Some common operators include:
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %
    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    Logical operators: and, or, not
    Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=


Java: Java also has a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, and assignment operators. Some common operators include:
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    Logical operators: &&, ||, !
    Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
    Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=
    


JavaScript: JavaScript also has a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, bitwise operators, and assignment operators. Some common operators include:
    Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **
    Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    Logical operators: &&, ||, !
    Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
    Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=

C++:
C++ provides several built-in container classes for storing collections of data, including arrays, vectors, lists, maps, and sets.
Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same data type.
Vectors are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
Lists are linked lists that can be used to store elements of different data types.
Maps are associative arrays that store key-value pairs.
Sets are collections of unique elements.

Java:
Java provides several built-in collection classes in the java.util package, including ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap.
ArrayList and LinkedList are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
HashSet and TreeSet are sets that store unique elements.
HashMap and TreeMap are maps that store key-value pairs.

Python:
Python provides several built-in collection classes, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
Lists are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
Tuples are immutable collections of elements of different data types.
Sets are collections of unique elements.
Dictionaries are associative arrays that store key-value pairs.

JavaScript:
JavaScript provides several built-in collection classes, including arrays, sets, and maps.
Arrays are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
Sets are collections of unique elements.
Maps are associative arrays that store key-value pairs.
